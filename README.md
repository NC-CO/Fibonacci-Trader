# FibonacciTrader

Automatically plots significant peaks and vallies in stock market graphs. Stock graphs are generated using a stock market API which pipes in live stock data. If a set of significant points resembles a harmonic pattern (bullish bat, bearish crab, etc.), it will be highlighted in yellow and a predicted rise or fall of the future stock price is illustrated with a dotted line. The user can select from any major stock on the left side bar and it will instantly populate the webpage.
